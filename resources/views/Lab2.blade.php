        <p> In Lab 2, I encountered a lot of difficulties. Initially, I planned a simple layout where entering a username would display a welcome page for that user with a button for the homepage. However, I decided to challenge myself by creating a more complex design. I made it so that the username would display on the homepage, which turned out to be more difficult than expected, especially since I decided to change the layout into a hotel-themed webpage. This required me to start from scratch, but I enjoyed the process, especially when I got the parameters to work properly.
        Creating the contact form was easier for me, as it involved building another webpage where users could input their name, along with a button to notify them that their message was sent. The hardest part was passing the username parameter correctly, as it wasnâ€™t being read properly at first. I had to track down where I went wrong and ensure I was using the correct route. After some troubleshooting, I managed to fix it. The task became more challenging because I completely changed the design of the pages, but in the end, everything turned out well.
